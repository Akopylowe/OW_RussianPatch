# OW_RussianPatch
Russian localization for Old World game

Feel free to contribute.

Text files references can be found at C:\Program Files\Epic Games\OldWorldTestBranch\Reference\XML or C:\Program Files\Epic Games\OldWorld\Reference\XML

There the text-something.xml contains the text you need to change. Some text is still hardcoded and not present in these files.

# Installation and use
Download these files and put them in D:\User\Documents\my games\OldWorld\Test\Mods or D:\User\Documents\my games\OldWorld\Mods (or similar). Launch Old World, set up a new game and go into Advanced Setup to find the mod and enable it. Start the game and go into Options -> UI -> Languages -> Russian (Russia) and save.

Ready to play in Russian!

If you want to load an existing game you need to: Setup a new game -> Go in Advanced Setup -> Enable the mod -> Go back into Main menu -> Load a game and choose your save -> Launch it and set the language in options

# Be aware
When starting Old World, it will looks for the latest used language. If this one is Russian, because it is not included yet in basegame and mods will not have loaded, Old World won't find it and so switch language to DEBUG. This will cause text to not be localised until you set language to English or another language
